<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWell, I finally made it to the Netherlands and as you can 
imagine its been a busy first week and a half. As far as plane rides go, mine was about as bad as you 
would except. I succeeded in getting no sleep, an unsatisfying breakfast, and much to my surprise when 
you fly in coach you don’t even get to pick personal movies. When I landed things started to go much 
smoother, or maybe I was too sleep deprived to notice the difference, regardless I traversed the Dutch 
rail system and found my way about 35 minutes outside of Amsterdam to my new home of Delft. I then 
beelined for my apartment where I prompted passed out for a few hours. I awoke to the sounds of what I 
though was a burglary only to discover that my two new roommates had arrived. An Australian from the 
Gold Coast and Singaporean from none other than Singapore. Just when I though dinner might be an interesting 
event the two of them begged to go to the Subway down the street, leaving me with the sinking feeling that 
I was becoming the epitome of an American tourist. The next three days were mostly a whirlwind as the 
school (TU Delft) ran all of the international students for the semester (about 250) through an introduction 
program. The main goal of this being to help us make friends while also telling us a few things about how 
classes were going to work. The shocking part about this program was the amount of cheap or even free alcohol 
(usually 1 euro) that was dispensed to students. Pretty much ever day would end in bar on campus with an 
impressively diverse bunch of people. I think it took me two days to meet my first other American, as we 
certainly seem to be the minority in this exchange program. I actually prefer this as I’ve met people from 
Italy, Spain, Norway, Germany, and pretty much every other major European country. </p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow I’m sure during this whole time there has been one question 
on your mind that I have been so clever as to avoid: what about the biking? Well let me tell you, it became 
abundantly clear to me within about hour of being in the country that I might need a bike. Literally one of 
the first thing the girl at the train station said to me is that in the Dutch culture they have a saying 
that basically goes “you haven’t gotten on your feet until you have your bike.” As the first few days pressed 
on, I watched in horror as all my friends purchased bikes and worse yet the infrastructure is pretty much 
build around having a bike. All the most direct paths are for bikes and they even have these cute little bike 
traffic lights. So on about day four, with my feet hurting and soul crushed (my walk to school is about 30 
minutes each way) I hung my head in shame as I ordered a bike. Side note, they have a super cool service 
here called Swapfiets that will outfit you with a bike, do any and all maintenance you might need for 
that bike, all for a flat fee of 12 euro a month. This is the service I am currently using. But, sadly 
for me this is really only the start of my saga. If you didn’t already know, I don’t really know how to 
ride a bike. The six-year-old kids you see riding outside in your neighborhood are no doubt better than 
me. I got my Swapfiet early this week at school and was hoping that I would be a total natural able to 
ride it back home, no problem, with almost zero experience. Needless to say, that didn’t work. I 
couldn’t even get on the devilish contraption, let alone try to pedal it home. I had only one option, 
I walked my bike the entire 30 minutes silently cursing myself for not learning earlier. I then took 
myself in the dead of night onto a large empty court and proceeded to try and learn how not to fall over. 
I made some good progress, but after about an hour or two I was cold and still could barely ride a bike 
so I went back home. The next day after arming myself with YouTube videos and words of encouragement form 
my parents, I was able to pedal the thing around and sort of control it. I would say that is still about 
where I am right now, hopefully with enough practice I might be able to ride to school sometime next week.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll of that is plenty of excitement, but I actually had 
my first week of real classes in this time too. I’m only taking three right now, but the school is 
on a quarter system so by the end of my time I will have taken six. I’m in two electrical engineering 
electives and then intro to Dutch. As best as I can tell my classes are going alright so far. The 
funny thing about the Dutch school system is you never actually enroll in any classes. You show up 
to your classes if you want and if you have decided it’s a class you want to get a grade in you put 
your name down on the list of people taking the test about two weeks before the final exam. That 
is one of the biggest cultural shocks for me, since in about a month I am going to need to register 
for my classes at Pitt for when I get back. One final note until next time, there has been a 
remarkable lack of girls in wooden shoes here. I am also going to throw some of my basic contact 
information for anyone who is curious in a list right below this. </p>
	<p> (Best way to reach me): Whatsapp +1 (480) 352-2278 </p>
	<p> (Email): lbr2016@gmail.com </p>
        <p> I currently have a different Dutch phone number, but it doesn’t have much of a US international 
        plan so it’s better to reach me via the ways above or Facebook if you prefer. Regardless, this 
        means any messages you send to my old phone number I will not see until I get back to the US. </p>
