    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This weekend I had the pleasure of experiencing my first Dutch holiday. The holiday is called Konings Dag,
       or Kings Day, the celebration of the Dutch king’s birthday. So naturally, everybody in the country goes into 
       the streets to drink the entire day away. Who would I be to question their culture, which lead to me spending 
       the entire day in Amsterdam partying in the streets. I started the day early and went into the city to begin my 
       adventure with a big plate of pancakes. Oddly enough, it was probably the first time I’d eaten pancakes in the 
       Netherlands. As ashamed as I am to admit that, I can be pretty picky about pancakes so I was worried they might 
       be over hyped. They for sure don’t make American style pancakes but all and all they were pretty good. After the 
       breakfast, we picked up some beers and began to walk in steady circles around the city. I really enjoyed seeing 
       the party boats going through the canals. Basically, what a booze cruise would look like if it were in a small 
       boat with kegs of beer and a remarkable lack of railings. Honestly, I can’t believe I didn’t see anybody fall out 
       of those boats. Nevertheless, after walking around for a while we decided to pop into a bar and hang out. This 
       hang out turned into a rather long time and before we knew it most of the night had slipped past us. I caught a 
       train back and overall had a fantastic time. All I can really say is that the Dutch really know how to party! 
       The rest of the weekend I spent recovering from the holiday. As for the rest of my week, I spent it going to 
       classes and doing very little of interest. I look forward to this weekend because I plan on taking it easy and 
       hopefully visiting Haarlem. Oh also, I am still working on the website redesign too, don't worry.</p>
