    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello again! This week I did almost nothing exciting. 
      My final exams for the quarter are coming up so I sat indoors trying to prepare for them. Therefore, 
      I am going to keep this week's post short and sweet in an effort not to bore you. I didn't even take any 
      interesting photos either, so you will notice that this post is rather bland in many ways. My upcoming news is the only
      thing of value that I can share with you. Next week I will be in Rome. This is a trip that I have really been looking
      forward to, as I studied the wonderful language of Latin for almost 7 years in school. It is also one of the few 
      legendary European cities that I have yet to travel to in my life. Unfortunately for the blog, I will be traveling next 
      Wednesday and will not be able to post anything next week. I'm also not going to commit to posting anything the following
      week because I will be taking finals then. You might be thinking that it is a bold move to try and spend five days in Rome 
      and then come back to attempt my final exams, but this happens to be the way my plans fell together. Wish me luck! Promptly after
      I finish my last final exam, I will be heading to the airport to grab a plane to Prague. I will spend four days there, 
      over Easter, enjoying what that city has to offer. This location is one of the other places I have desperately 
      been trying to get to. This trip was made possible thanks to one of the only short breaks that I get while I am
      here. And just in case you didn't think I am cramming enough into a two to three week period, I will also be spending
      a day in Brussels this Saturday. Wow, just writing that out sounds insane. I will do my best to document these trips
      and with any luck this blog should have a few interesting posts to come. I also put the website redesign on hold 
      while I try to navigate the slew of activity I have planned for myself. Thanks for reading and I hope you 
      have a wonderful rest of the week! </p>
