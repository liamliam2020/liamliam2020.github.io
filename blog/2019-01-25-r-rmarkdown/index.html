<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWelcome to my very first blog post! I’m creating this as a
way to hopefully share some of the experiences and travels that I have during
my semester abroad. For those of you who might not know, my Spring 2019 semester
will be spent at TU Delft in the Netherlands, instead of my typical Pittsburgh
residence. The university is located about 35 minutes to the Southwest of
Amsterdam, or 10 minutes outside of Rotterdam, in the small city of Delft. Originally
the city’s claim to fame was a mix of their pottery manufacturing, known as
Delft blue pottery, and breathtaking canals. However, it also holds a special
place in fine art thanks to Vermeer who was born there in 1632.</p>   
	<h4><img src="/blog/2019-01-25-r-rmarkdown/delft-canal.jpg" alt="Delft Canal Img." width="672" /></h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudying abroad as an engineer can be tricky to pull off thanks 
to the number of credits we need to graduate and the fact that very few schools abroad meet the
standards required by Pitt Engineering to count as transferable credits. That’s
why Delft may seem like an odd choice compared to London, Sydney, or any other of
the major cities people typically study in. In reality, this school and
location were actually my top choice. The school itself is the most highly
regarded university on the list that Pitt had pre-approved. Ranking #1 in the
Netherlands, #6 in Europe, and #19 in the world for Engineering and Technology
schools. Moreover, the location of the school, on continental Europe, is
perfect for my needs. With Delft as my home base, I should be able to make use
of the extensive train system in Europe to visit many of the major cities in
the area.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis leads into the meat of what this blog will be 
focusing on. I will be mainly writing about the countries and cities that I plan on visiting or 
about significant adventures I hope to have while in the Netherlands. I’ll do my best to capture
pictures that you all might enjoy along the way. As of now, I don’t have any
plans on how often these posts will appear, but I doubt I will be making more
than one ever two weeks. I am also open to feedback, so please let me know if you
have any ideas on how I can improve this blog. Moreover, this website was actually
coded by myself, so if you encounter any bugs, broken links, or issues with the
format I would be happy to fix/address them. Finally, my journey has not actually
begun! I arrive in the Netherlands on the 5th of February and look
forward to sharing more information with you all after I have settled down a
little.</p>
