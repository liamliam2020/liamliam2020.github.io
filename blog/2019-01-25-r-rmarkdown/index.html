  <div id="typed-body"> 
      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Welcome to my very first blog post! I’m creating this as a
          way to hopefully share some of the experiences and travels that I have during
          my semester abroad. For those of you who might not know, my Spring 2019 semester
          will be spent at TU Delft in the Netherlands, instead of my typical Pittsburgh
          residence. The university is located about 35 minutes to the Southwest of
          Amsterdam, or 10 minutes outside of Rotterdam, in the small city of Delft. Originally
          the city’s claim to fame was a mix of their pottery manufacturing, known as
          Delft blue pottery, and breathtaking canals. However, it also holds a special
          place in fine art thanks to Vermeer who was born there in 1632. </p>  
      <h4><img src="/blog/2019-01-25-r-rmarkdown/delft-canal.jpg" alt="Delft Canal Img." width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Studying abroad as an engineer can be tricky to pull off thanks 
          to the number of credits we need to graduate and the fact that very few schools abroad meet the
          standards required by Pitt Engineering to count as transferable credits. That’s
          why Delft may seem like an odd choice compared to London, Sydney, or any other of
          the major cities people typically study in. In reality, this school and
          location were actually my top choice. The school itself is the most highly
          regarded university on the list that Pitt had pre-approved. Ranking #1 in the
          Netherlands, #6 in Europe, and #19 in the world for Engineering and Technology
          schools. Moreover, the location of the school, on continental Europe, is
          perfect for my needs. With Delft as my home base, I should be able to make use
          of the extensive train system in Europe to visit many of the major cities in
          the area. </p>
      <h4><img src="/blog/2019-01-25-r-rmarkdown/tu-delf.jpg" alt="TU Delft Img." width="672" /></h4>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis leads into the meat of what this blog will be 
          focusing on. I will be mainly writing about the countries and cities that I plan on visiting or 
          about significant adventures I hope to have while in the Netherlands. I’ll do my best to capture
          pictures that you all might enjoy along the way. As of now, I don’t have any
          plans on how often these posts will appear, but I doubt I will be making more
          than one ever two weeks. I am also open to feedback, so please let me know if you
          have any ideas on how I can improve this blog. Moreover, this website was actually
          coded by myself, so if you encounter any bugs, broken links, or issues with the
          format I would be happy to fix/address them. Finally, my journey has not actually
          begun! I arrive in the Netherlands on the 5th of February and look
          forward to sharing more information with you all after I have settled down a
          little.</p>
