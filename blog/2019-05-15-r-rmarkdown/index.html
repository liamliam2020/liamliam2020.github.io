    <h4><img src="/blog/2019-05-15-r-rmarkdown/picOne.jpg" alt="City Skyline." width="672" /></h4>      
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello again! This week I had my 
      first venture into Germany, namely Cologne. It was only a brief stay as I 
      was there Friday morning to Saturday night, but I think I managed to squeeze 
      everything out of city. The trip there was rather long because my train ended 
      up getting an hour and a half delay for some unknown reason. Naturally this 
      added delay made me very hungry, so my two friends and I dropped our bags at 
      the hostel and set off in search of food. We stumbled into what seemed like a 
      traditional German restaurant, so I opted to order schnitzel in the hopes it 
      would be tasty. Indeed, it did not disappoint and I found myself wondering if 
      I would be able to bring myself to order anything else while I was there. After 
      getting ourselves sufficiently nourished, we walked over to the massive cathedral 
      that I want to say is the hallmark of the city. I must admit, it is easily one of 
      the largest church buildings I have ever seen, not as big as the Vatican, but 
      certainly the biggest standalone cathedral I have ever seen. Of course, we walked 
      around inside of it too, but I was much more impressed with the sheer magnitude of 
      the outside. Afterwards, we walked across a large railroad bridge that was covered 
      in locks, similar to the lock bridge in Paris. Best of all, on the other side of the 
      bridge there were some really amazing views of the city. We spent the rest of the day 
      exploring the city and then returned to our hostel for some much need rest. The following 
      morning, we visited a wonderful modern art museum in the city center. They also had an 
      assortment of other art styles that were fun to see. We spent most of the morning here 
      and then headed to a pub to spent the last of our hours sampling the world-renowned 
      German beer. Finally, we left for the train station for what we had assumed would be 
      the easiest part of the trip, training home. My friends had talked me into taking the 
      train route with them that required three transfers, something I normally avoid. Upon 
      arriving at the station, we discovered that our first train was delayed fifteen 
      minutes. This isn’t usually a big deal but some of our connections were only 
      fifteen-minute layovers. I figured we were sunk and would certainly miss our 
      connecting train, but luckily that train was twenty minutes late. At this point, I 
      was just trying to cross the border into the Netherlands where I knew trains actually 
      came when they are supposed to. Honestly, I had kind of figured that the Germans, 
      who I often though of as a very efficient group of people, would have trains that run 
      on time. I was really unimpressed by this because out of the three train carriers 
      I rode in Germany not a single one of them had a train on time. Oh well, now I 
      know the Dutch trains are world class. </p>  
    <h4><img src="/blog/2019-05-15-r-rmarkdown/picTwo.jpg" alt="Cathedral Closeup." width="672" /></h4>
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Later in the week, I finally made it 
      to the largest tulip garden in the Netherlands called Keukenhof. Literally just 
      in time too as the garden is set to close this coming weekend due to the end of 
      the tulip growing season. While all the tulip fields that surround the garden 
      were all harvested, the inside of the garden was still incredible. It was actually 
      an overwhelming number of flowers. I don’t think I realized just how many different 
      kinds of tulips exist. One of the things I was most hopeful to do while in this 
      garden was to find a girl in wooden shoes. I thought for sure this huge touristy 
      park would have at least one worker dressed up. Sadly, I didn’t find exactly what 
      I was looking for but I certainly found something worth sharing. The garden had 
      these massive wooden shoes set up that people could get their photos in. Naturally, 
      I decided to take a selfie while a girl was in one of these wooden shoes. It’s not 
      the photo my dad was hoping for but its looking like it might be the closest thing 
      I can find. </p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lastly in other news, I made some time 
      to convert part of this website over to my new design. Hopefully you all enjoy it, 
      but I am open to feedback! I am still slowly working on moving the rest of the pages 
      over to the new format as well. Thanks for reading, I’ll see you next week! </p>
