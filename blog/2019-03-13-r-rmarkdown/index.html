<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Dutch weather leaves a little bit to be desired for. 
  For the first month I was here, it’s been unseasonably nice weather. At my orientation the dean of 
  students had joked that we probably wouldn’t see the sun until April at the earliest. I had written 
  that comment off after all of the sun, but now I think I’m starting to understand what he meant. 
  For example, the past week has been rainy, cold, and windy. Apparently, this is how the climate is 
  normally supposed to be. Rain and cold, not a big deal, I’ve dealt with that before. What has been 
  destroying me is the wind. I’ll have you know, it’s no because I’m ruined from the beautiful weather 
  in Phoenix. Oh no, it all comes back to biking. As most of you know, I have been steadily improving 
  my biking skills. I bike ever day to school and pretty much everywhere that I need to go. The only 
  exception being the grocery store because I’m still too afraid to figure out how to carry all my 
  bags while staying upright. I like to think that I’m starting to move out of the novice category and 
  more into an intermediate level. Thought I still haven’t mastered taking my hands off the handlebars. 
  However, this week’s weather has made me start to reevaluate my skill. At the start of the week, I had 
  figured that the wind would probably blow through and for the time being I wouldn’t use my bike. Well 
  after 3 days of waiting to bike it occurred to me that maybe the wind wasn’t going anywhere. So, 
  reluctantly I tried to ride my bike to school despite the wind. I don’t know how often you go out and 
  try to bike in 20-30 mph winds, but I’ll tell you it’s difficult. I find it even more incredible that 
  no matter what direction I am traveling, the wind is always against me. It’s like mother nature has 
  decided since I can sort of ride a bike its time to dial up the difficulty. The odd thing is the wind 
  can be strong enough to blow people off their bikes, I’ve seen it happen. But, the Dutch aren’t even 
  phased by this. These people look outside in the morning, see pouring rain and trees shaking from the 
  wind, and think “looks like a great day for the bicycle.” I’m not convinced that they have a full 
  understanding of the weather they live in. A normal human being would except that in a climate with 
  so much rain and wind, a rain coat and boots might be appropriate. Wrong, the Dutch pretty much don’t 
  wear these. Its like they get some sort of satisfaction from getting soaked. Regardless, my bike and I 
  are still trying to figure out how to overcome these challenges, I’ll keep you posted on how it goes. </p>

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Besides my biking endeavors, this week I decided to check 
  out Rotterdam. My impetus for visiting here was twofold. First, I wanted to see a concert there for a 
  small electronic artist. Second, I had heard that Rotterdam had some really cool modern architecture and 
  I wanted to check it out. I was able to drag a friend along with me for the sightseeing, but couldn’t 
  convince him to stay for the concert. Mainly because things start late here. Anyway, after a 10-minute 
  train ride we arrived at the massive train station that is Rotterdam Central. This thing rivals an airport 
  with the number of shops and restaurants it contains. One of the coolest parts was this building had a super 
  interesting design, as seen in the picture above. After leaving the station, we were both struck by how the 
  city is like a modern take on a classic Dutch town. For example, check out the picture of one of the cannels 
  we came across. While there weren’t too many cannels here, all of them seemed to have this modern style to 
   where the water and walkways are super close. </p>

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A little bit more walking took us to what I think is called 
  the Erasmus bridge. It’s your classic ultra-modern bridge and is one of the big picture points in the city. 
  We walked across it hoping to find some cool things to do, but were sorely disappointed when we ended up in 
  a fairly industrial area. Thus, we promptly walked right back across. As for the last part of our journey, 
  we randomly walked into a restaurant whose menu appeared to be a blend of barbeque and Italian. The meal 
  itself was kind of weird, as the blending of those two foods would be, but overall I enjoyed that it was 
  unique. My buddy and I then hung out at a bar until about midnight when the doors to my concert finally 
  opened. Unbelievably the concert started at 1:30am and ended at 6am, needless to say I only lasted until 
  about 3am. I left the city tired and wet (because of course it was raining), yet excited to come back for 
  another visit sometime soon. As for this coming week, I had originally thought I might go to Belgium for 
  St. Patrick’s Day, but have since decided that I better finally go see Amsterdam and then Den Haag. 
  Hopefully it will leave me with a lot to write about! Thanks as always for reading and I’ll see you 
  again next week. </p>
