      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to my final blog post! I’ll start out by thanking everyone who 
        has taken the time to keep up with my adventures and for reading my imperfect attempts at English. Today I am going to try 
        and do a review of my experience abroad. I’ll try to give you what I thought were the best and worst parts, what I would do 
        differently, and then give my final thoughts on the experience as a whole. The photos I include with this post with be a 
        weird amalgamation of stuff that I have been withholding from you. With that said, I’m going to dive right into the content. </p>  
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-06-19-r-rmarkdown/picTwo.jpg" alt="Amsterdam sunset." width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think starting with the best and worst parts of an experience is always a fun 
        overview. So, I picked two of each to share and I’ll start with the worst parts first. One of the suckiest things about my semester 
        here has been the different timing of the Dutch school year. I had to wait over a month after my school semester ended to start my 
        studies here. Then, I will only have about a month after my studies end to spent at home before I have to go back to school. I don’t 
        actually mind too much the shorter summer, but the one big down side for me is that getting a summer internship became almost impossible. 
        Its not the biggest deal in the world, but having more current work on my resume would have been really nice. The next thing that was 
        difficult is being so far away from my family and friends. It doesn’t really set in until you get here, but having a nine-hour time 
        change and a trans-Atlantic flight to get home are hard. Moreover, I really miss the American optimism in regard to where hard work 
        can get you. I think what it really came down to is having to look at your country from the outside in for a long period of time can 
        start to make you feel isolated. </p>
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-06-19-r-rmarkdown/picThree.jpg" alt="One of many bike rows in a single small train station." width="672" /></h4> 
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily, I was able to deal with these worst parts and I found myself dwelling more 
        often on the upside. For example, one of the most amazing things about living and schooling in a foreign country are the awesome people 
        you meet. Of course, I loved the Dutch and their laid-back attitudes, but I really mean all the other exchange students from around the 
        globe that I got introduced to. I ended up being one of very few Americans, so I had the pleasure of making friends with people from 
        Portugal, Sweden, Australia, and many more places. Its been super eye opening to see that, for the most part, people from all around 
        the globe are pretty similar. Everyone is trying to make friends, do well in school, and live the best life they can. It forces you to 
        realize that the world is a much friendlier place then it is sometimes made out to be. Next, having the ability to hop on a train and in 
        a few short hours been in up to six different countries is incredible. Europe is amazing small giving me a great opportunity to see a 
        ton of different countries and cultures. This is easily one of the best reasons to study abroad in Europe. Finally, as an added bonus, I 
        think I need to touch on the subject of biking. I started off not just opposed to it, but completely convinced that biking would kill me. 
        I tried to hold out, but eventually I had to get a bike because this entire country is built around the silly things. I learned how to 
        do it complaining the entire time, while also hiding my shame about not figuring it out sooner. Its with great reluctance that I can say 
        that I don’t hate it anymore. In fact, sometimes on a really nice day I find it to be fun. That’s all I’m willing to concede there. </p>  
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-06-19-r-rmarkdown/picFour.jpg" alt="Tulips." width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m not usually one for big regrets, so there aren’t too many things I would do differently. 
        However, one major thing that I think would have been a good idea is to learn some more Dutch. I gave up because the class I was taking was 
        way too intense, but that doesn’t mean that I should have stopped trying all together. With the number of language learning apps, it would not 
        have been difficult for me to have picked up so more of the language. While I never found that I needed Dutch, it might have added more to the 
        experience from a cultural perspective. The only other thing that comes to mind is that I wish I had better documented my time here better. I 
        mean that both in terms of photos (and I took more than I usually do already) and in terms of a diary of some sort. This blog ended up being my 
        biggest resource of what I actually did while I was here, but I found it easy to forget all the things that happened after a few jam-packed days. 
        As for the rest of my time here, I think it worked out exactly how it was meant to and I would never want to change it. </p>
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-06-19-r-rmarkdown/picFive.jpg" alt="Flower garden" width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I imagined writing this post, I also wanted to do a section about what I learned. Well I 
        learned that I learned way too much to write down in a single post. But, ill throw in some of my biggest takeaways for fun! I learned trying new 
        things won’t hurt you, you get what you pay for (in the most literal sense), slowing down to enjoy a moment is really pleasant, and that we have 
        it pretty good in the US. Ultimately, I am so happy I was able to have this experience. I think I was able to visit eight countries (with three 
        more to come) and too many cities to count. But, at the end of the day the Netherlands has been easily my most favorite place of all. I’ve grown 
        to call this place home and always feel an immense sense of relief when I get back here from other countries. I don’t think I could have asked 
        for a better place to study abroad. I feel so lucky to have had this opportunity and I would really just like to thank everyone who has made this 
        possible from the bottom of my heart. Special thank you to my Mom and Dad for helping me every step of the way. I can’t wait to see you all when 
        I get back home! </p>
