  <h4><img src="/blog/2019-03-20-r-rmarkdown/picOne.jpg" alt="Sunset in Dam." width="672" /></h4>          
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Welcome back to my continuing saga, this week 
      I was successful in finally seeing Amsterdam. Going to Amsterdam has been a little bit of 
      a sore subject for me. Originally, I had planned to go about a week after my initial arrival 
      here with a tour led by a club at my school. Unfornatley, I stayed up way too late the night 
      before and ended up sleeping through that one. Then, about two weeks later, a bunch of my 
      friends decided we would all go and check the city out. I ended up having to work on an 
      assignment with my lab partner pretty much the entire day, so I missed that one too. After 
      these two close misses, it started to become a running joke with my friends that I was just 
      never going to actually go. But, now I can say without a doubt that you shouldn’t skip Amsterdam. 
      The city is basically a bigger and busier version of Delft. One of the things I really liked is 
      that the city as a whole is really walkable. I think we spent about five hours there just 
      wandering around the many canals and side streets. Dam square, picture featured above, was one 
      of the many open areas we came across and easily one of the most photogenic. </p>   
  <h4><img src="/blog/2019-03-20-r-rmarkdown/picTwo.jpg" alt="Church in AMS." width="672" /></h4>
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp All the walking got me sufficiently hungry so we went 
      out in search of food. My friends claimed 
      that around the red-light district there were some excellent places to eat, so I skeptically went 
      with it. I think they might have been right, as the Italian place we ended up in was incredible. 
      Moreover, the bakery we stopped in for after dinner waffles was also delicious. Since we were all 
      full, the next natural move was to head over to Rembrandt square to check out the night life. The 
      bar we ended up finding was apparently one of the oldest hip-hop bars in world, an utter waste on 
      me as I don’t listen to anything from that genre. I definitely liked Amsterdam and will be going 
      back to check out more of the city’s sights. </p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The following night was of course St. Patrick’s Day, 
      so a few friends and I decided to go into The Hague to check out the festivities. Our only real 
      goal was to find an Irish pub and then sit in that pub for however long felt right. Luckily for 
      me, the first pub google maps could find was deep within the city so I got a change to see some 
      of the Hague too. I’m ashamed to say that I was so busy enjoying my walk that I only snapped one 
      photo. This is especially sad because the Hague is one of my favorite places I have been so far. 
      I thought it had a bit more of a modern vibe going on, similar to Rotterdam, but there was still 
      a lot of the older more interesting buildings as well. I also didn’t see a lot of canals, so the 
      city was able to have a lot of winding roads and an interesting closed in feeling. The Hague is 
      also the seat of government in the Netherlands so I was hoping I would just stumble across the 
      parliament building, sadly I couldn’t be so lucky. I guess that means I’ll be making another trip 
      here as well! </p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To cap off this post, I feel its only right to tell 
      you how my biking is going. With a very red face, I must inform you that I succeed in falling 
      off my bike for the first time this week. I want to say that we all knew this was eventually 
      going to happen. Thankfully, I wasn’t hurt and my bike seems to be alright as well. As for how 
      this could have happened, I’m going to gracefully blame another biker. I was happily biking 
      along, as I do, when I came up to a part of the road that has been under construction. So, the 
      bike lane has this abrupt left turn in it and to make things worse both sides of traffic have to 
      squeeze through this turn in a sort of a small space. Well one of the bikers in the other side 
      of traffic (coming at me) decided he wanted to take up the entire lane. I slammed on my pedal 
      brakes, but I was going too fast to stop, so I try and just squeeze through this turn anyway. 
      Well I ended up clipping the side of a barrier, and promptly bouncing off of it. I didn’t 
      actually fall off my bike, but I was certainly stopped dead in my tracks. I also opted to 
      take a hot second to just stand there and access my body to make sure I wasn’t injured. Good 
      times. I like to think that this has really helped me grow as a biker, if anything it has 
      given me a healthy reality check. My goal for this week is to actually stay on my bike! </p>
