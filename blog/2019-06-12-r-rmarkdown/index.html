      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had another wonderful week in the Netherlands. In my effort to see more 
        of the country, I decided to visit Utrecht and Gouda. I did not have any set plans for either location, but I had read some 
        blog posts to give myself an idea of what might be fun. First stop was Utrecht with two of my friends. The main thing we all 
        noticed was how many people there were. This place was literally packed with crowds rivaling that of Amsterdam. The nice thing 
        about a crowd is that you can just follow it from the train station to wherever the major attractions are. This led us to the 
        Dom Tower. Unfornatley (and evermore a trend on my visits throughout Europe), the tower was going through some restorations so 
        much of its beauty was obscured. We then moved on to follow the main canal in the city. This one is especially unique by Dutch 
        standards because it’s sort of double decker. By that I mean, there is a main walkway above the canal set a little way back, 
        then you can take stairs to go down right next to the canal. My picture demonstrates this more easily than words. Anyway, we 
        walked along this canal for a while doing some window shopping and eventually selecting a spot to sit and have lunch. It was a 
        really cute city to sit in and observe. For the rest of the afternoon, we just did some exploring mixed with sitting along the 
        canal enjoy some beverages. </p>  
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-06-12-r-rmarkdown/picTwo.jpg" alt="Two Story Canal." width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following day, I dragged a friend to see Gouda with me. I picked this place 
        for really one reason and that is Gouda is where one of my favorite cheeses is produced. We got off the train and started to make 
        our way into the city center when it occurred to us that not only was ever business closed, but also that the place was a ghost town. 
        It made wandering the small side streets of the town really fun, but I was left with the feeling that not a lot happens in this town. 
        Later on, while enjoying some lunch and chatting with our waiter, we learned that apparently it was a holiday so that’s why nobody was 
        there. Honestly though, I think the town is just really not a big place. I think we walked around the entire place in less than an hour. 
        Emptiness aside, they had a really cute town hall and an even cooler cheese house where they weight all the cheese in their weekly 
        market. I’m really happy I visited but its not a place I would rush back to anytime soon and certainly not on a holiday. </p>
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-06-12-r-rmarkdown/picThree.jpg" alt="Gouda Town Hall." width="672" /></h4> 
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an added bonus from that same holiday, I realized that I didn’t have any classes early 
        in the week. So, I went in to the Hague on a rainy day to see one of the museums that has come highly recommended, the Mauritshuis. It has a 
        really nice collection of Dutch masters like Rembrandt and Vermeer. While it was on the smaller side, it was very cool to visit and a great 
        way to spent a rainy day. Lastly a little bit of housekeeping, I think if you have been reading this consistently you should notice that the 
        new theme is fully integrated on the site. I still have some work to do as far as bug fixes and some more content to tweak, but the blog section 
        should be done. Side note, I’m really happy because all the code behind the site is finally nearly organized and super easy to read making 
        development way better for me. However, as a fair warning this site is actually designed to be my profession website, so my blog really 
        shouldn’t live here forever. It feels like more effort than its worth to make a sperate site just for my blog to live on, so at some point 
        near the beginning of August I will be making the blog unviewable. If for some reason you feel strongly about keeping a post feel free to 
        message me and I can send you a copy. Otherwise, as hard as it is to believe, I only have one more blog post left before my semester abroad 
        ends (It could be two but I’m going to take off exams week again). I’ll be staying on about a month past the end date of my school to travel 
        on my own and with my family, but I have no intention of uploading any posts about that. I figure it gives us all something to talk about in 
        person next time you see me :D. Thanks for reading this week and I look forward to writing the final installment of my blog next week for you! </p>
