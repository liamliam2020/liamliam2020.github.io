    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Welcome back, this week was exciting for both me 
      and this blog! A few people have been asking me to add a comment section to this blog and 
      I finally got around to doing it. I’m confident in your powers of observation, but just in 
      case the comment section is located at the bottom of each blog post and should work on most 
      browsers. Although for whatever reason, I couldn’t post blog comments when I tried in Firefox, 
      so if that’s your browser of choice I recommend Chrome, Safari, or even Edge. If you use 
      Internet Explorer, do yourself a favor and switch to a new browser because I haven’t been 
      adding compatibility for you (web developers across the world will thank you too). Moreover, 
      I have been working on a complete theme redesign of this site too. I hope to have it done by 
      the end of the week or maybe even by the time this blog post goes live! Please let me know what 
      you think and more importantly if you find any bugs/broken links. </p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As for my adventures this week I found myself exploring 
      Amsterdam much more in depth. On Saturday, I decided to go into the city alone and just wander 
      around for the afternoon. I was really excited to finally do this because last time I was there 
      was with four other friends making aimlessly walking around not a viable option. Amsterdam is 
      laid out in a half circle fashion with the canals cutting the city into smaller half circles. 
      The major touristy part is in the center half circle, which is exclusively where I spent my 
      time on my last trip. So, this time I ventured out into a further semi-circle and thus got to see 
      a more residential part of the city. It was a peaceful experience and I was able to capture a lot 
      of cool photos too. I also had a little bit of a sub-agenda too, which was trying to figure out 
      how to effortlessly navigate the city on my feet. </p>
  <h4><img src="/blog/2019-03-27-r-rmarkdown/picThree.jpg" alt="Random canal." width="672" /></h4>
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The following day, I was able to check a major European 
      study abroad goal off my list: I went to a real soccer game! It was a EuroCup qualifier game 
      between the Netherlands and Germany. I think I am correct in saying that it was my first professional 
      soccer game too. As for the level of excitement around this game, I was utterly blown away by the 
      fans. It all started when my friends and I entered into the metro station to get to the game. Right 
      away, I heard loud chanting and started to see people dressed in bright orange (that’s the Netherlands 
      home color). But when I say dressed in orange, I mean like literally people in bright orange suits, 
      pants, hats, anything you can thing of. Its almost a little jarring because the only time I usually 
      see that color is on emergency service personnel or stadium officials. All of this is only compounded 
      by the fact that people can just legally drink in the subway, so you see people with their six-racks 
      of beer singing pretty much acting like hooligans. Once we got into the metro, you could feel them 
      shaking the train for the entire ride. As for the atmosphere in the actual stadium, it was next 
      level. I think the only kind of American sporting event that creates the same energy is the Olympics 
      because of their sense of national pride tied in with the match. Best of all, I actually got to see 
      an exciting game. The only damper being that the Netherlands lost in the last minutes with a final 
      score of 3-2. But, I’m really glad that I went to this game as it was one of those experiences I 
      won’t soon forget. </p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Now I won’t leave you without at least mentioning my 
      biking too. So far, I have yet to run my bike into any obstacles this week. Additionally, as much 
      as it pains me, I really do see the utility of riding my bike as it has become my major form of 
      transportation. I just wish I could ride along without having to use my hands, it almost looks 
      fun! I see the Dutch kids chugging around just texting with both hands off the handle bars, as if 
      they are mocking me. I guess that means I need more practice. Also, on a sperate note, some of you 
      may be wondering how I am doing with a task my Dad gave me. The task being to find a girl in 
      wooden shoes and to get a photo with her, preferably with a windmill and tulips in the background. 
      I will have you know that contrary to popular belief these girls don’t grow on trees. I have been 
      searching high and low for over a month now with absolutely nothing to show for it. I figured that 
      at least in Amsterdam I could find somebody posing for tourist, but no such luck. I’ll keep looking, 
      but my hopes are starting to get dashed. I don’t have any plans for next week as of yet, but I’m 
      sure I’ll think if something in the meantime. See you next week! </p>
