      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Welcome back to the blog, this week was full of excitement for me! 
          For my first real trip outside of the Netherlands my friends and I decided to keep it simple. London, 
          somewhere that speaks English and is easy to get to, was an obvious choice. I arrived early on Friday (3/1) 
          and was rewarded with perfect British holiday weather. In other words, it was cloudy, cold, and rainy. After 
          a short 2-hour bus ride, I was dropped off right by my hostel. My first order of business was finding a 
          Nando’s. If you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a London based Portuguese style chicken chain that the 
          locals love. They only serve chicken, which has been marinated in a special sauce over night. I think the picture 
          below does it more justice than any of my words will. </p>  
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-03-06-r-rmarkdown/picTwo1.jpg" alt="Nando's." width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After fueling up, my buddies and 
          I went to our hostel to check in. Mind you, this was my first experience with a hostel so I was a little bit 
          worried if it would hold up to my previously pampered standards. As we walked up to the hostel, we spotted a 
          crowd that was easily 20 people just sitting outside of our door. My mind went instantly to the worst, 
          excepting that the hostel was some sort of scam or that there had been a fire. Happily, this wasn’t the case 
          as these kids were just waiting for a bus or something and I was able to seamlessly check into my room. Now 
          when I say my room, I mean the room I shared with 12 other guys. All things considered the room was fairly 
          nice so my friends and I locked our stuff away and prepared to explore the city. We wanted to get the touristy 
          bits out of the way first so we set out for the Buckingham Palace and Parliament Building. This wasn’t my 
          first time in London, but I got a completely new perspective of the Parliament 
          Building. Big Ben is entirely covered in scaffolding right now, while being a little disappointing, it 
          forced me to really check out the architecture of parliament. Moreover, by the time we had walked ourselves
          over there it was just about sunset, so parliament was catching some really beautiful light (sadly none 
          of my pictures turned out very good). After a long day of sightseeing, we figured it would be a good idea to 
          take a break. Naturally, going out for some light drinks with a few people we met in the hostel would fulfill 
          this. The folks we had met said they knew a great spot over by Piccadilly Circus, which I only later found 
          out was SoHo. We grabbed a bus then followed them down this dark back ally to a little building with a 
          massive line out front. Apparently, their idea of light drinks and mine were radically different because 
          this was a high-end night club in an expensive part of town. My first though was, whelp there is no way I’m
          getting in here the line is way too long. This was closely followed by my observation that everyone was 
          wearing pretty nice attire, while I was dressed in jeans and t-shirt. I was figuring out how I was going 
          to get back home, when this girl in our group cuts the entire line and name drops some guy, Alex, that 
          apparently works there. I guess Alex must have been important because all of the sudden I’m being dragged 
          into this club without having to pay their expensive cover and horribly underdressed. The club itself was 
          pretty cool, it had 3 underground floors that got progressively darker and louder. The only caveat being 
          that they only played Spanish dance music. We hung out there for most of the night and had a lot of fun 
          despite our tiredness. </p>

      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe next morning, we were up bright and early so we could check 
          out tower bridge. We pretty much just wandered around that area most of the afternoon until hunger forced 
          us into a random pub. A relaxed meal of fish and chips made us feel better, so we set out for St. James 
          park to enjoy what had turned into a really pleasant day. Afterwards, in an effort to actually take it easy, we decided 
          to hang out in our hostel’s common area for the night. I had a pretty good time and learned some interesting
          French and Spanish card games from other hostel goers while I was at it. I then went to bed early and got 
          some much-deserved rest. For our final full day in the city, we really wanted to spend it hanging around and 
          just enjoying what London had to offer. We started in Leicester Square, popped over in China town 
          accidently, and ended up looking through some stores in SoHo to end it off. All and all it was a 
          really exciting trip and a good way for me to get my feet wet with traveling kind of by myself. Best of all
          I learned a lot about how I could maximize my fun for future trips. </p>

      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow I know all of you are wondering how my biking is going. Thanks
            to the encouraging words I received from you all, I took the plunge and I now bike to school ever day.
            I’m not the best biker on the streets, but at least the Dutch just zoom by me when I’m going to slow for 
            their taste (almost all the time). Better yet, I think I might finally be getting the hang of this 
            dreadful activity. I’m trying to work myself up to getting a biking selfie, but I’m not comfortable with 
            the classic “look mom no hands” just yet. Finally, some housekeeping, I will be making an active effort 
            to get a blog post up ever week from now on. I would expect that Wednesday will probably be the day these
            go live. Thanks for reading my blog! As always, feel free to let me know if there are any improvements you
            would like to see. </p>
