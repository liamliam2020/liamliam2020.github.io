    <h4><img src="/blog/2019-04-26-r-rmarkdown/picOne.jpg" alt="Grand Palace Brussels." width="672" /></h4>          
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I’m finally back after my 
      long travel hiatus. Now I will do my best to recall all of the important 
      details from Brussels, Rome, and Prague. My trip to Brussels was the shortest 
      of the three, lasting only one day. I woke up early on a Saturday and took a 
      roughly two-hour train ride directly to the city. My first though was how easy 
      it is to just train into another country. I know how the free travel zone in 
      Europe works, but it is still kind of weird for me that I was able to just 
      travel into another country without anyone even asking for my passport. 
      Anyway, upon arriving in the city with my friend we figured we would just wander 
      around until we got hungry enough to eat. It turns out we are expert level 
      wanders because we just sort of ended up in front of the grand place without ever 
      opening a map. The square that the place sits in is easily one of the most 
      impressive parts of Brussels and we really enjoyed just taking it in. It also helped 
      that it was still pretty early in the morning so we practically had the sights to 
      ourselves. We then stumbled upon a really cute café for what ended up being the 
      first of many Belgian waffles. I should note, we came to the city with only one 
      goal, which was to eat Belgian waffles as often as possible. Next, we decided it 
      would be fun to check out a newly opened modern art museum. The museum itself was 
      one of the cooler buildings I have had the pleasure of exploring in recent memory, 
      as it was a repurposed warehouse. My buddy and I really enjoyed the exhibits and sort 
      of lost track of time while we were taking it all in. Then I recalled that the Atomium, 
      or as we fondly referred to it as the metal balls, was supposed to be pretty cool too. 
      We made the mistake of assuming that it couldn’t be that far from the city, so we opted 
      to walk. For two reasons this was dumb, first we had forgotten that hills were a thing 
      thanks to time in the Netherlands and second the public transit is not only very fast, 
      apparently it was cheap too. Regardless, we had a really fun walk and stumbled into a 
      beautiful park just besides the Atomium. I sort of thought the park was better than 
      the actual exhibit we were there to see. After a pleasant down hill walk back into the 
      city, we both indulged in some street waffles and set out to try the famed Belgian beer. 
      The tap house we went to had over 100 different beers and everything we tried was 
      delicious. We spent the rest of our afternoon tasting new beers and then headed back to 
      the train station to caught a ride home. I enjoyed the day trip very much, but felt like 
      that was just about the right amount of time to spend there. </p>  
      <h4><img src="/blog/2019-04-26-r-rmarkdown/picTwo.jpg" alt="Atomium." width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Only three days later, I hopped on a plane 
        to Italy to finally set eyes on Rome. The first thing my two friends and I decided to 
        do was check out the Coliseum. I enjoyed this a lot, and found just walking among Roman 
        ruins to be surreal. 
      <h4><img src="/blog/2019-04-26-r-rmarkdown/picThree.jpg" alt="Military Shrine." width="672" /></h4>
        We ate a quick meal of pizza and then headed back to the hostel 
        for some much-needed rest. As we were sitting in our beds relaxing, a guy from Pitt who 
        is a year older than me and also in my same major walked into our room. It must be a 
        pretty small world, because I never expected to run into someone from my school, who I 
        knew, just casually in the same exact hostel room. He was traveling alone after just 
        graduating, so we ended up taking him with us on our adventures for the rest of the 
        stay. The following day, we walked over to the Vatican with the intention of just 
        spending a little bit of time there. That didn’t happen, as after we had seen the entire 
        inside of the church, we decided to pay a little extra to go to the very top as well. I 
        have no regrets, as the top of the Vatican was easily the best part. The view of Rome was 
        incredible and better yet there was even a little café near the top of the dome as well, 
        which we made full use of. 
      <h4><img src="/blog/2019-04-26-r-rmarkdown/picFour.JPG" alt="Me and Friends on the Vatican ." width="672" /></h4>
        With only a little bit of light left in the day, we practically 
        ran over to the Spanish steps and Trevi fountain. Both these attractions were nice, but I 
        vastly preferred the fountain. Its even more impressive than the photos, as just the shear 
        volume of water coming out of the fountain can be heard well before you see it. To end this 
        busy day, we did a little bit of partying in an American bar one of my friends had been to 
        before. After arriving home, it occurred to us that we hadn’t even gone to any of the many 
        museums around the Vatican. So, we made plans to check out at least one of these museums the 
        next day. I ended up just wanting to see the Cysteine chapel so we picked the museum that 
        housed it. I wasn’t too impressed by the actual museum as it was very crowded and full of very 
        similar pieces. However, the Cysteine chapel was worth the price of admission. I was awe struck 
        by the chapels ceiling and could only look on in silence as I attempted to take the entirety of 
        the piece in. After spending most of the day there, I decided it would be nice to walk around the 
        Borghese park for a little while. It ended up being a perfect time, as we were able to caught 
        the sunset while we wandered about. I then departed from my friends and went to meet up with my 
        grandfather for dinner. The timing of my trip was apparently perfect because it just so happened 
        that him and I were in the city during roughly the same time. He generously treated me to some 
        proper Italian food, but I found it most fun to just sit with him a caught up for a while. 
        Moreover, I’m not usually a very homesick type of person, but seeing some family after spending 
        a large amount of time in a foreign place was very refreshing. After departing ways, I opted 
        to take full advantage of the separation from my friends and went to indulge my Roman ruins 
        curiosity further. We had yet to walk through the Forum, and in the end never did, but I had 
        really wanted to poke around that area. I spent a few hours just walking around the outside of 
        the Forum/Coliseum aimlessly looking into the scattered remains. This might have been one of my 
        favorite moments of the trip because I was able to just sit and reflect in an area had I learned 
        so much about during my education. This led me into my final day in the city. My friends and I 
        set out to see the capital museum, which ended up being the best museum that I visited. It was 
        full of interesting roman artifacts and had an amazing view into the Forum. It also felt like 
        every photo I took was perfect. 
      <h4><img src="/blog/2019-04-26-r-rmarkdown/picFive.jpg" alt="Forum." width="672" /></h4>
        Next, we moved onto the Pantheon as I had heard it was 
        interesting to see. Overall, it was fun for about 15 minutes and after that it didn’t really 
        have much to offer. On that note, we went looking for food and headed back to the hostel to pack 
        our things. I really enjoyed Rome, finding it almost overwhelmingly full of things to see. I hope 
        to go back again sometime in the future. </p> 
      <h4><img src="/blog/2019-04-26-r-rmarkdown/picSix.jpg" alt="Red Roofs Prague." width="672" /></h4>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My final trip was Prague in the Czech Republic. My 
          first day in the city we went to check out the Prague castle. Before we got too far into the 
          walk, we stopped for a little breakfast. To my surprise they had excellent food that almost 
          reminded me of the types of breakfast one would find in California. Anyway, the castle sits 
          overlooking the city, thus giving a spectacular view of the surroundings. The castle itself had 
          a really interesting church and was filled with a bunch of museums too. After spending some time 
          exploring the area, we walked back into the city and stopped by the John Lennon wall. Its 
          basically just a large mural of random Beatles pictures and lyrics. All the walking got us tired, 
          so we opted to head to the hostel for some drinks. We ended up having a bit of a lazy night and 
          grabbed some food nearby before going to bed. The following day was pure exploration. We saw a few 
          other of the main tourist attracts then headed up to a local park to enjoy the beautiful weather. 
          We didn’t stay that long in the park because I was getting a sunburn and we all wanted to get back 
          to the hostel because it was karaoke night. We had an awesome night of singing old American songs 
          with a bunch of non-native English speakers. I even got my friend to sign a song for the first time 
          in his life. My friends we all leaving in the morning, which meant I was on my own for the rest of 
          my trip. To celebrate this, I decided to spend my day alone walking through an old monastery near 
          the city. All of the trees and flowers were blooming making the walk even nicer. This marked the end 
          to my journey in the Czech Republic. I must say that I really enjoyed Prague and found the city to 
          be as beautiful as the internet claimed. However, after all of this international travel, I will be 
          trying to take a break and hopefully get over the cold that I picked up from sleeping in hostels 
          for too long. </p>
