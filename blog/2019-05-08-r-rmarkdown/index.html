    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello again, this week ended up being 
        remarkably normal for me. I had planned originally planned to visit Haarlem, but 
        after a cold and rainy storm system moved in, I opted to stay at home instead. Fear 
        not, for I used this restful weekend to my advantage setting out the basic plans 
        behind the rest of my travels while I’m here! I’ll be in Cologne Germany this weekend, 
        then Luxembourg and Paris in the coming weeks, with even more to come after the 
        semester. As hard as it is to believe my time here is starting to come to a close. It’s 
        under two months left of school. As for my studies, I figured I would use this post to 
        really talk about what I do when I’m not travelling. This quarter I have only three 
        classes a robotic design class, a linear algebra class, and a business venturing class. 
        The robotic design class has me grouped up with eight other students with the goal of 
        designing a robot that can follow a black line on the group, while also avoiding obstacles 
        in its path. Right now, we are still very much in the design phase, but so far the classes 
        is really exciting. As for my linear algebra class, it is actually one of the last math 
        classes I have to take. Once it’s done, all I will have left is statistics, which is crazy 
        to me because when I first read the requirements for my degree, I didn’t know how I was 
        going to finish so many math classes. I have also really been enjoying this math class 
        unlike a lot of the calculus I had to take. What I really like about it is that one can 
        see the direct crossovers into computer science and even some of my electrical engineering 
        courses. Finally, my business venturing class I cannot say a lot about for two reasons. First, 
        the way this classes transfers back to Pitt results in it not counting for any credits. This 
        means I don’t really care about the class because it doesn’t do anything for me. I’m simply 
        enrolled in it because TU Delft requires that I have a certain amount classes and I didn’t want 
        to overload my schedule with difficult classes. This why it was really helpful for me to be 
        taking full credit loads while I was at Pitt, because now I have some freedom in my schedule 
        to enjoy my study abroad. Second, the class is at 8AM, so even though it looks interesting I 
        often end up wanting sleep more than I want to sit in a lecture. I plan on going to a select 
        few of the lectures because I can see from the class schedule that they will be covering some 
        topics of interest to me. Otherwise, that class is mostly a write off for me. That’s what my 
        studies are looking right as of now. I don’t really have any interesting photos to go along with 
        this so hopefully this wall of text wasn’t too daunting. </p>
