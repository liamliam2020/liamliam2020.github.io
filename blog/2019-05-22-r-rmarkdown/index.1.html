    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello again, this week I decided to go check 
      out the Hague! I have been here a few times before this, but I had never set aside for 
      a full day to just walk around it and see what there is to do. Actually, I don’t think 
      I had ever been there before in the daylight. So, I hopped on a train and set out to 
      explore what turned out to be one of the coolest Dutch cities I have visited. After 
      getting off the train, I was struck by modern buildings mixed with the more classic 
      ones. This was a totally different sight than Rotterdam because it felt much more 
      like the new mixed in with the old. Rotterdam, on the other hand, is the new and the 
      newer mixed in with the single classic building that was somehow missing during the 
      bombings in World War 2. Anyway, while in the Hague I tried to see all the important 
      Dutch government buildings. Then, I set off to go see the Peace Palace. This is where 
      the international court of justice is located. The building was really impressive, 
      but they have it locked down pretty tightly, so I wasn’t able to get much closer than 
      the outside fence. Afterwards, my friend and I set out to hike for a little while in 
      a large park nearby. I found this especially pleasant because there are very few places 
      in the Netherlands where you can go to just be surrounded by trees. To end the day, we 
      relaxed in a beer garden near the center of the Hague and enjoyed what was one of the 
      most pleasant days I have seen in a while. </p>

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I think its probably well past the time for me to update 
      you on my biking adventures. I still ride my bike just about ever day. I’ve gotten pretty good at 
      not falling off and I can even ride with one hand. I could probably stand up and petal too, but I 
      never really try because it’s so flat here. I think it is fair to say I’m pretty assimilated on the 
      biking front. As for next week, I will be in Luxembourg hopefully having an excellent time. It should 
      also be a bit of quiet week because there are some weird Dutch holidays that cancelled one of my 
      important classes all week long. With any luck I’ll use the extra time productively, less for traveling 
      and more for organizing myself. Thanks for reading! </p>
