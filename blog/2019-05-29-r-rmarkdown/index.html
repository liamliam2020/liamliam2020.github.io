      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Welcome back to my blog, this week I had the chance to 
        visit Luxembourg. My primary reason for visiting this small country was because I have been trying 
        to visit as many of the places that are close to the Netherlands. I had not really heard much about 
        the country and really had no idea what to expect. I learned while traveling there that the country 
        is sort of hard to get to, as the train ride was six hours long. Upon my arrival, I booked it straight 
        to my hostel to check in. I found it rather hilarious that the only hostel near the city was actually 
        at the bottom of a large hill. I guess this would be one of those examples where you get what you pay 
        for. Anyway, I dropped my bag and took a little tour of the city. This was rather easy as the place is 
        super small and pretty easy to navigate. To my surprise, the city was impressively cool. The whole thing 
        is built into craggy bluffs, with what almost looks like large stone walls carved out of it. I spent the 
        entire day just wandering around the base of the city taking pictures to my hearts content. </p>

      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The following day I decided to explore and hike around another 
        nearby fortification. I had the feeling of walking around a castle from Game of Thrones. It was just 
        unbelievable to me that people built such a heavily protected city. I ended up spending the entire day just 
        walking around old castle walls and wandering through the nearby hills. Another cool aspect of the city was 
        the fact that they had tons of marked trails to follow. I had noticed a blue flag marker that I had seen all 
        over the city the day before and decided to follow that for as long as I could. Well, that turned out to be a 
        complete death march in a circle none the less, as I walked ten miles and did something like ninety floors of 
        stairs. But, in my defense the path was really fun to follow and it almost felt like a treasure hunt looking 
        for the sporadically placed makers all over the city. After celebrating my long circular walk, I went back to 
        my hostel and slept like a baby. My final day in the city I decided to take it easy. I walked around a really 
        pleasant park in the middle of the town. I then went back to the train station and spent the rest of my day 
        trying to get back home. Luxembourg is a super cool city and I couldnâ€™t be happier that I decided to go there. 
        My final trip before the end of my school will be to Paris this weekend. I look forward to sharing my 
        experiences with you next week.  </p>
