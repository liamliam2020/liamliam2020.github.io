      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello again, this week I had the pleasure of visiting Paris. I departed 
        by train and was really impressed at how close Paris is to me, only two and a half hours away. Upon my arrival, I 
        thought I would simply walk over to my hostel. I really under estimated how large Paris is as it took me nearly an 
        hour to walk all that way. With little daylight left, I dropped my bags and quickly walked over to the Eiffel 
        Tower to enjoy the end of the day. Luckily for me, my hostel was just about a ten-minute walk from the sight. I sat 
        on a bench and watched the tower for some time until hunger eventually forced me to search out dinner. I ate a quick 
        meal and walked back to my hostel to get some sleep. I was super lucky because for whatever reason the hostel I had 
        selected was especially nice. The beds were comfy and the room was practically empty so I felt like I was staying 
        in a real hotel for a change. </p>  
      <h4><img id="typed-image" src="/blog/2019-06-05-r-rmarkdown/picTwo.jpg" alt="Louvre." width="672" /></h4>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning, I set out for Monet Museum housing, I think, the 
        largest collection of Monet pieces in all of Paris. But before I could handle all that artwork, I needed to fuel up with 
        breakfast. I went to a place called HolyBelly, which came heavily recommended by my parents. I got there within twenty-minutes 
        of its opening and found myself waiting in a line for another fifteen-minutes. In this time, I got to wondering how good the 
        food could be, but mostly flabbergasted at the number of Americans waiting in line with me. Once I finally got a table, I 
        ordered a large stack of pancakes that were covered in bourbon butter, fired eggs, hash browns, and crispy bacon. It was 
        utterly delicious. The bottom of the receipt said that they hoped to see me again tomorrow and I was in total agreement. 
        Next, I took the metro to the museum and prepared myself for what I expected was going to be an impressive showing. I spent 
        roughly an hour and a half there just enjoying the assortment of Monet works that they had. Additionally, the museum itself 
        was really cool to see because they had designed the space specially to show the pieces in it. I think I learned that the 
        way art is displayed is an artform in and of itself. Afterwards, I spent some time enjoying a pleasant park next to the 
        museum before taking the metro back into the heart of the city. I found myself on a train towards the Louvre so I figured 
        I might as well just go there and walk around the outside for a bit. I had forgotten just how large the park outside of 
        that museum is, so I really spent some time just getting lost. Eventually I happened across some lounging chairs and 
        proceeded to spend the better part of the afternoon just sitting and enjoying the day. I should mention that the weather 
        the entire time I was in Paris was absolutely excellent, maybe even too much as I ended up getting a bit of a sunburn. My 
        next order of business was to go see Notre Dame since I was really curious as to the extent of the damage to the landmark. 
        Sadly, it was really hard to see anything because there were large metal walls set up all around the base of the church. 
        Moreover, the part where the roof had collapsed was covered in scaffolding, obstructing my view more. As best as I could 
        tell, the main towers of church looked unmarked while the roof looked in shambles. For sure a sad sight to see, thought I 
        found it really interesting to see the church in its burned-out state. By this time, I had used up most of the day so I 
        opted to grab another quick dinner and head to bed. </p>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my final day in the city, I really wanted to visit the Pompidou Center 
        where all the modern art is held. But to start, I had to get another of HolyBelly’s excellent breakfast. I was happy to find 
        that this time there was no wait and I was able to quickly order my food. I decided to really go all in today, so I ordered 
        scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, sausage, pear juice, and afterwards a piece of chocolate brownie cake. It was really 
        yummy. I just wish I could have eaten at this place even more than I did. I then popped over to the Pompidou and waited in 
        line for them to open the museum. I think I spent about two and a half hours here maybe even a full three just wandering 
        around their many exhibits and enjoying one of the best modern art museums I think I’ve ever been to. I wouldn’t say I’m the 
        biggest fan of most modern art, but I am really a sucker for some of abstract works (think Jackson Pollock) and more so for 
        the exhibits where you can interact with the works. I only had a little bit more time left before I had to grab my train, so 
        I went to the Place des Vosges to sit and read my book. I really enjoyed my time here and was sad when I eventually had to 
        leave to go find my train. This trip really felt like my first vacation, as I was able to sit back and relax in a wonderful 
        place. Now I am back in Delft and starting to prepare myself for my final exams. Its hard to believe that my time here is 
        nearly over, but I’m hoping to make the most of my last few weeks of school by really exploring some of the spots in the 
        Netherlands I have neglected. See you next week!</p>
